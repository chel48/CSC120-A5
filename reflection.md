- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I like how association connects everything and makes the program run as more one entity rather than multiple entities occurring on their own. Most of this assignment went pretty well, I just had trouble configuring inputting the message so that it would be defined before the banner class was called. At first I tried to define the scarecrow and then re-assign message, which didn't work. Overall the assignment went smoothly.
